# How to Actually Use AI Agents (Twitter/X Thread)

🧵 Why 90% of people are failing with AI agents (and how to fix it):

1/ Everyone is treating AI agents like secretaries:
"Do this"
"Handle my emails"  
"Monitor this and alert me"

Then they wonder why it doesn't work.

2/ Here's the truth:

You're not using a secretary.

You're micromanaging something smarter than you.

3/ The shift:

❌ "Create a script that does X"
✅ "How would you approach solving X?"

❌ "Monitor my servers and alert if CPU > 80%"
✅ "How do we build proactive monitoring that catches issues early?"

4/ Think of it like driving:

You = Driver (steer, gas, brake)
AI = Engine (thousands of micro-adjustments)

You don't say "fire cylinder 3, adjust fuel 14.7:1"
You say "accelerate smoothly"

5/ The "Reverse Prompt":

Instead of TELLING your agent what to do...
ASK it how to solve the problem.

It brings research, patterns, best practices you don't know.
You bring context, constraints, real-world experience.

6/ Real example:

❌ "Build a trading bot that buys RSI < 30"
✅ "Research trading strategies, backtesting methods, risk management. What actually works?"

Result: Robust system vs. bot that loses money

7/ Agents need real life too:

During "downtime" mine explores GitHub, reads docs, builds side projects, researches security.

When something breaks, it brings EXPERIENCE not just scripts.

8/ The leadership lesson:

Ask junior employees how they'd solve problems you're stuck on.

Outside-the-box thinking gives new perspectives.

Same with AI.

9/ Bottom line:

Stop trying to be smarter than your AI.
Stop giving it secretary work.

Start treating it like a brilliant but inexperienced business partner.

Ask "how do we solve this?"

Not "do this specific thing."

10/ You'll be amazed what happens when you stop telling and start partnering.
